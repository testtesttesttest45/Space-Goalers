## Overview

Space Goalers is a self-learning project I made, inspired by Captain’s Ball and built on top of Photon’s Quantum Space Arena Brawler sample. 

Players can win the game for their team by carrying the Objective Ball to the opponent’s goal area, or achieve more team goals before the game time is up.

Aside from just passing the Objective Ball around, players can equip and use various abilities to the match, causing chaos all around!

**Ability List:**
- **Dash**: Quickly dash forward
- **Speedster**: Briefly allow the player to move faster
- **Invisibility**: Become invisible and unseen by opponents. If holding Objective Ball, it will not become hidden with the player
- **Banana**: Drops a banana that can provide a short speed boost to teammate or slow down an opponent
- **Punch**: Punches an opponent in front and apply knock back
- **Block**: Gain a shield that blocks the next damaging ability
- **Hook**: Launches one hand forward to grab the first opponent closer to player
- **Bomb**: Hurls a ticking bomb that explodes and knock backs all opponents in the radius
